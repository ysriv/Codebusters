# Project Name 
TrashBuddy - Share Trash,Save the Sphere



# What does it do?
All of us generate trash somehow or the other. Whether it is as simple as drinking that soft drink,or something complicated like constructing a house.

Inspiration The inspiration of TrashBuddy was drawn from the Life of "Nek Chand Ji", one who made the entire "Rock Garden" of "Chandigarh,India". He dedicated whole of his life to make world clean by reusing the Trash.
Our primary goal is "Share Trash,Save the Sphere". So, to achieve our goal we made a medium which is TrashBuddy . Basically, this is like a social media platform, where the users can interact with people of similar interest. In TrashBuddy, users can provide trash to those creative minds which can make a worth out of it. It is just a gateway between Trash Givers and Treasure Makers.


# Challenges
Being novel to these kind of tasks, our team came across various challenges including GUI, implementation of Google Login etc
